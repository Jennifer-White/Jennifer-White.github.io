# Who is Jennifer White?

With over a decade of experience in Cisco Networking & Microsoft Windows administration plus modern cloud skills (AWS, Azure, & GCP!) leveled-up by recent SANS classes, I'm ready to jump into a career in cybersecurity & clouds. The best asset I bring is my enthusiasm for technology that can't be learned! 

My fascination with tech started in 3rd grade homeroom class where school's cool-factor was power-leveled by the introduction of two IBM PC's to the back corner of the classroom. Along with The Oregon Trail game, the setup was used as an incentive to earn good grades (no issue there, so I got my playtime!) I was obsessed! I had to find out what made these machines work, but I'd have to wait until my teen years to start tackling that. Back then, I had to settle for crossing virtual rivers and packing enough supplies to hit the trail! My very own first-PC was a much later model, (Compaq Presario with an AMD K-6). I learned PC components and the ultra-modern Windows 95 with that rig- and I've been computing ever since!

Transitioning into cybersecurity is a natural and necessary path for me after more than a decade of managing computer networks. Blue team/On-prem network & cloud security with maybe a splash of forensics is where I hope to land. CompTIA Security+ Certification will be attained Dec 2022 (back to the basics!!)
